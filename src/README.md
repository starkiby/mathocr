# Mathematical Optical Character Recognition (MOCR)

MOCR is a Python package for optical character recognition of mathematical formulas. The goal of this project is to provide an efficient and user-friendly tool to help users recognize and parse mathematical formula images.

## Features

- Supports various mathematical formula image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, etc)
- High-accuracy recognition using deep learning models compared to other open source MOCR

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python version: 3.12
- PyTorch version: To Be Determined
